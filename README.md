# Fifa21
It's a project to showcase data cleaning, transforming and visualization techniques, dataset pulled from Kaggle
Some of the ideas and inspirations are, what are the top 10 players of the world, what info can I get from them, i.e. their wage, BP, nationality, names, values, etc.

And because of some of the libraries don't allow the visualization on GitHub you can use this link to be able to see all the graphs in a proper fashion:
